If you press Enter over a file that is not executable, the Midnight Commander checks the extension of the selected file against the extensions in the Extensions File. If a match is found then the code associated with that extension is executed. A very simple macro expansion takes place before executing the command. (debian => /etc/mc/mc.ext)
 
Previous directory. You can jump to the directory you were previously by using the special directory name '-' like this: cd -
 
Macro Substitution
When accessing a user menu, or executing an extension dependent command, or running a command from the command line input, a simple macro substitution takes place.

%s and %S
The selected files: The tagged files if there are any. Otherwise the current file.

Special Settings
old_esc_mode
By default the Midnight Commander treats the ESC key as a key prefix (old_esc_mode=0). If this option is set (old_esc_mode=1), the ESC key will act as a prefix key for one second, and if no extra keys have arrived, then the ESC key is interpreted as a cancel key (ESC ESC).
