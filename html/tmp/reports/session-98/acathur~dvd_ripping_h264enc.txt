##h264enc

A well written interactive shell script that uses mplayer's mencoder program and  
x264 codec to do the job. It can also create matroska files.   

After install/download run:  

	$ h264enc -sc  

to check if the dependencies you need are all there.
Put DVD in the drive and run:  

	$ h264enc -scan  

and see what you got in that DVD. You can also try:  

	$ mplayer -dvd-device $your_dvd_device_here dvd://$track_number  

to find the track that should be used.  

Now, DVD can be converted directly using h264enc or by first dumping it to a raw  
mpeg video file and converting that file with h264enc. In dumping method you first  
need to run:  

	$ mplayer dvd://$track_number -dumpstream -dumpfile $movie_name_dumpfile.vob  
h264enc needs at least two options to run. First the passmode and then the preset.  
For more information do RTFM! (https://duckduckgo.com/?q=!wiki+RTFM). For example:  

	$ h264enc -2p -p hq  

will excute the program in 2-pass mode with High Quality preset and helps with a  
step by step guide through the rest of the ripping and transcoding process.
And that's it. h264enc is interactive, very intutitive itself and has a good manpage!  

Good luck.
